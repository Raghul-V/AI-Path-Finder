# AI Path Finder

## Description

This is a simple AI path finder that uses a DFS, BFS, GBFS and A* algorithms to find the shortest path between two points on a 2D plane with obstacles.

The visualization starts with a bit of configuration, then the next two points you place will be the start and end points. Then you can draw some obstacles on the grid and the AI will find the shortest path between the two points avoiding the obstacles.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Tkinter

## Usage

To see the AI path finder in action, simply run the `path_finder.py` file.
